# Nootebooks

This folder is organized based on the chapters of the thesis *Exploration of network dynamics approaches to description of brain response to stimulation*.

- `00_structural_connectivity` shows how structural connectomes are loaded and how they look like, compares them
- `01_f-tract` replication of the work presented in paper *Communication dynamics in the human connectome shape the cortex-wide propagation of direct electrical stimulation* by Seguin et al.
- `02_pytepfit` application of the methodology by Seguin et al. to TMS-EEG empirical and simulated data
- `03_compare_f-tract_pytepfit` comparison of the results obtained form F-TRACT and TMS-EEG empirical data
- `XX_centroids_and_parcellations` all notebooks related to mapping of parcellations so all the data in previous foders are compatible with each other
